# Task State

Last updated: 2026-04-10 10:25 UTC

## Current status

- Description: Keep PR #229 merge-ready while tightening the MacBook OpenClaw/iOS boundary and host Telegram delivery policy.
- Active repo: `/Users/prismtek/BeMore-stack`
- Branch: `fix/openclaw-build18-agent-workspace-ux`
- Last successful step: applied host OpenClaw delivery policy, added repo-side boundary/policy doctors, and verified PR #229 was clean before this follow-up patch.
- Next intended step: run repo checks, commit, push, and confirm the PR checks restart on the new head.
- Verification complete: false
- Manual steps remaining:
  - watch the new PR head checks after push
  - verify live Telegram delivery with a real long response from Cody's channel
- Safe to resume: true

  - Repo: `/Users/taylor/development/BeMore-stack`
  - Branch: `codex/ios-shell-surfaces-a`
  - Files touched: none yet on this branch
  - Last successful step: access gate, baseline build, and baseline simulator verification passed on current `master`; current master already includes persisted tab management, buddy rename/active selection persistence, and Models route control.
  - Next intended step: implement focused PR A deltas rather than re-creating already-landed work
  - Verification complete: false
  - Manual steps remaining: code/doc edits, rebuild, simulator verification, PR B feasibility call
  - Safe to resume: true

  - Repo: `/Users/taylor/development/BeMore-stack`
  - Branch: `codex/ios-shell-surfaces-a`
  - Files touched: Mission Control shell/docs plus repo-backed surface view
  - Last successful step: fetched `origin/master`, confirmed PR `#212` landed at `2026-04-09T18:53:22Z`, rebased onto build `13`, and restored the in-progress shell/doc changes cleanly
  - Next intended step: rerun required build + simulator checks, then publish PR A and separate runtime-blocker PR B
  - Verification complete: false
  - Manual steps remaining: rebuild, final simulator verification, PR publication
  - Safe to resume: true
