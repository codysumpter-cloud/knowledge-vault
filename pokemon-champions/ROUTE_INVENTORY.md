# prismtek.dev Route Inventory

This file is the human-readable route map for continuing `https://prismtek.dev`.
The machine-readable source is `context/sites/prismtek.dev/ROUTES.json`.

## Priority order

### P0 - build first

- `/` - Home
- `/arcade-games/` - Arcade Games
- `/projects/` - Projects
- `/downloads/` - Downloads
- `/build-log/` - Build Log

### P1 - build after core content routes

- `/pixel-studio/` - Pixel Studio
- `/community-center/` - Community Center
- `/prism-creatures/` - Prism Creatures
- `/my-account/` - My Account
- `/mission-control/` - Mission Control

### P2 - build after core parity is stable

- `/memory-wall/` - Memory Wall
- `/school-safe/` - School Safe
- `/links/` - Links

## Homepage sections currently discovered

- global header / nav
- welcome intro
- quick-start CTA row
- featured games carousel
- creature showcase
- account actions
- footer

## Special route note

- `/mission-control/` currently exists in the donor site as the public web handoff surface for app access.
- In `prismtek-site`, the HTML route redirects to `/my-account/`, and the Cloudflare Pages function proxies requests to `app.prismtek.dev`.
- That means `BeMore-stack` does not currently own the live `prismtek.dev` web chat implementation by itself.

## Execution rule

When working a route, update all of the following together:

1. route status in `ROUTES.json`
2. acceptance state in `PAGE_ACCEPTANCE.md`
3. blocker or caveat notes in the active task state

## Status meanings

- `todo` = not yet migrated or reviewed
- `in_progress` = active migration work
- `blocked` = cannot finish without input or dependency
- `accepted` = route passes the page acceptance checklist
