# Knowledge Forge

Knowledge Forge is a local-first or self-hosted technical document digestion system for turning field-service source materials into trustworthy, reviewable knowledge artifacts.

Its job is to:
- accept *promoted candidate source packs* from FlowCommander (and curated source packs during bootstrap) covering authoritative technical documents, operational documents, and future source families
- register and classify those source documents
- pre-bucket them before heavy processing
- normalize and parse technical documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, images, and other supported formats)
- use the OpenAI API to extract canonical knowledge records
- use the OpenAI API to compile human-readable wiki pages
- detect contradiction and supersession candidates
- apply guardrails so low-signal operational material does not become published knowledge
- publish approved wiki output into the FlowCommander `repo-wiki` by pull request

Knowledge Forge is a separate system from FlowCommander. FlowCommander owns operational intake (field photos, emailed attachments, startup sheets, winterization docs, inspection forms, job PDFs, drawings, controller screenshots, service correspondence, notes) and the editorial *promotion* action that turns selected operational material into a Knowledge Forge candidate source pack. Knowledge Forge does not read FlowCommander's operational tables on its own. Hosted Supabase may store approved outputs later for retrieval, but it is **not** responsible for the digestion pipeline. See the FlowCommander-side canonical model in [`FlowCommander/docs/operational-intake-model.md`](https://github.com/TNwkrk/FlowCommander/blob/main/docs/operational-intake-model.md).

## Source material scope

Knowledge Forge must support a broader corpus than OEM manuals alone. The full field-service knowledge foundation includes:

### Authoritative technical documents
- **OEM installation, operation, and service manuals** — the core path today
- **Datasheets, specifications, selection guides, and certifications**
- **Fault-code, alarm, indicator, and troubleshooting references**
- **Service bulletins, revision histories, firmware release notes, supersession notices**
- **Parts lists, BOMs, and spare-parts catalogs**
- **Engineering drawings and visual technical documents** (wiring diagrams, schematics, P&IDs)

### Operational and contextual documents
- **Workflow guidance, SOPs, checklists, and seasonal procedures** (startup, winterization, PM routines)
- **Safety documents, permits, and hazard-control records** (LOTO sheets, confined-space permits)
- **Internal best practices, training material, and technician-reference material**
- **Field forms, inspection templates, and commissioning sheets**

### Future source families (not first-wave extraction targets)
- Controller, HMI, VFD, and network configuration backups
- Telemetry, alarm history, trend data, and syslog exports
- Work orders, service reports, and calibration records
- Photos, screenshots, videos, audio notes, and transcripts

The first-wave pipeline is built around PDF-centric authoritative documents. Operational documents and future source families should be progressively supported as intake, parsing, and extraction capabilities expand.

## Codex-ready baseline

This repository includes a lightweight local operating baseline so future Codex
work can proceed without guessing repo conventions:
- `AGENTS.md` defines repo-specific agent workflow and integration rules
- `WORKFLOW.md` defines the Symphony/Codex issue-execution contract for
  isolated, one-issue-at-a-time autonomous runs
- `docs/codex-issue-runbook.md` defines the standard one-issue-at-a-time Codex
  execution loop
- `.codex/` contains repo-local Codex defaults
- `.env.example` documents shared local environment variables
- `data/README.md` defines the local staging area for generated artifacts
- `docs/agent-workflow.md` explains the Knowledge Forge to FlowCommander working
  model
- `docs/evals.md` defines the lightweight fixture and golden-file eval skeleton
- `config/inference.yaml` now includes model pricing used for request cost
  estimation and inference log summaries

The setup is intentionally light. Durable behavior lives in repo docs rather
than hidden local automation.

Source-pack manifests for real-corpus onboarding live under
`config/source-packs/`. They define a reviewed document set plus the metadata
needed to register a repeatable manufacturer bucket without hardcoding ad hoc
one-off intake commands.

## Canonical entry points

Start here when orienting in the repo:
- `README.md` explains what Knowledge Forge is and how it differs from
  FlowCommander
- `AGENTS.md` defines operating rules, safe-edit guidance, and delivery
  expectations
- `WORKFLOW.md` defines the Symphony/Codex autonomous issue-execution contract
- `docs/codex-issue-runbook.md` defines the standard issue execution loop for
  Codex work
- `docs/linear-tracker.md` defines the Linear-first tracker model and PR
  handoff expectations
- `docs/roadmap.md` defines the phased implementation plan and issue sequence
- `docs/publish-contract.md` defines the FlowCommander publish boundary
- `docs/repo-structure.md` defines the intended repository layout and artifact
  flow
- `docs/agent-workflow.md` defines the two-repo workflow and phase boundaries
- `docs/evals.md` defines where future fixture-driven validation should live

## Python project bootstrap

Issues `#1`, `#2`, and `#3` establish the canonical Python package, local
developer tooling, and CI baseline for this repo:

- `pyproject.toml` defines packaging metadata, runtime dependencies, and the
  development extras used today
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` defines the shared local lint and format hooks
- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` classifies pull requests internally so docs-only
  changes get a fast successful pass, draft code changes get a cheap preflight,
  and ready code changes plus pushes to `main` run full lint/test
- `src/knowledge_forge/` is the package root for future implementation work
- `tests/` contains the initial smoke-test scaffold for imports and the CLI

### Local setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Local secrets with Infisical

Keep Python configuration environment-variable based. `OPENAI_API_KEY` should be
provided by Infisical at command runtime, not by committed files in this repo.
`.env.example` remains documentation only.

```bash
infisical login
infisical init
infisical run -- python -m pytest
infisical run -- python -c "import os; print(bool(os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']))"
infisical run -- python -m knowledge_forge.cli --help
```

If the project is already linked on your machine, `infisical init` may not be
needed again. The local Infisical link file is ignored by git.

### Current validation commands

```bash
knowledge-forge doctor
kf doctor
kf docs-check
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
python -m pytest
kf validate
python -c "import knowledge_forge"
python -m knowledge_forge.cli --help
```

`kf doctor` is a local readiness report for Python, package import, git state,
required docs, and expected environment variable presence. It does not print
secret values and does not make network, OpenAI, or GitHub calls. Missing
environment variables warn by default; use `kf doctor --strict` when an issue
needs all expected environment variables present.

`kf docs-check` verifies the core agent and boundary docs exist and keep their
minimum cross-references. Run it for docs, workflow, publish-boundary, or
handoff changes.

`kf validate` runs the local validation suite in order: `ruff check .`,
`ruff format --check .`, `python -m pytest`, and `git diff --check`.

To run these with secrets available:

```bash
infisical run -- kf doctor
infisical run -- kf docs-check
infisical run -- ruff check .
infisical run -- ruff format --check .
infisical run -- python -m pytest
infisical run -- kf validate
infisical run -- python -c "import knowledge_forge"
infisical run -- python -m knowledge_forge.cli --help
```

## Core model

This system is **not**:

`PDF -> raw chunks -> embeddings -> done`

This system **is**:

`document intake -> pre-bucket -> OCR/parse -> LLM structured extraction -> LLM wiki compilation -> review -> publish`

The parser recovers structure.
The OpenAI API converts that structure into canonical records and reviewable wiki output.

## Why this repo exists

FlowCommander needs a scalable way to digest a large backlog of technical source materials into knowledge that humans can inspect and that downstream AI systems can trust.

The existing incremental ingestion path is suitable for future uploads, but it is not the right shape for bulk backlog seeding. Knowledge Forge exists to own the heavier content-processing factory:
- intake and manifesting for all source document types
- pre-bucketing
- OCR and parsing (expanding beyond PDF to DOCX, XLSX, HTML, images, and more)
- OpenAI-powered extraction
- OpenAI-powered wiki compilation
- contradiction and supersession analysis
- publish/export tooling

## Repository strategy

Knowledge Forge should remain separate from FlowCommander.

### Knowledge Forge owns
- manifest and intake
- pre-bucketing rules
- normalization and OCR
- parsing
- OpenAI inference layer
- extraction schemas
- wiki compiler
- publish tooling

### FlowCommander owns
- product app
- Ask AI consumption
- approved imported wiki content
- downstream retrieval and storage contracts

## Publish boundary

Knowledge Forge should not directly mutate FlowCommander during normal processing.

Required flow:
1. Knowledge Forge processes manuals
2. It generates compiled wiki artifacts
3. It stages publish-ready output
4. It opens a PR against FlowCommander
5. That PR writes into a dedicated `repo-wiki/knowledge/` subtree
6. Humans review and merge

That keeps the process auditable, reviewable, and reversible.

## Working with FlowCommander locally

When available, use the local FlowCommander clone at
`/Users/taylor/development/FlowCommander` as the downstream reference point.

Use it to:
- inspect current `repo-wiki/knowledge/` structure
- validate that generated artifacts fit downstream expectations
- prepare publish-ready changes before opening a PR

Do not treat local repo access as permission to casually edit FlowCommander from
intermediate output. The approval boundary remains the FlowCommander PR review
process.

## First real bucket onboarding

Phase 10 onboarding can now register a checked-in source pack through the CLI:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m knowledge_forge.cli intake register-pack \
  config/source-packs/rockwell-pump-station-control-stack.yaml
```

Curated source packs may intentionally span several product families while still
rolling up into one manufacturer-scoped subsystem bucket. When that happens,
manifests preserve the real document family and also carry a `curated_bucket`
hint used only for bucket assignment and cross-source compilation.

## Goals

### Primary goals
- build a reliable digestion pipeline for the full field-service source corpus — authoritative technical documents first, operational documents progressively, and future source families over time
- pre-bucket source documents (manuals, bulletins, SOPs, checklists, forms, drawings, and other classes) before LLM processing
- accept *promoted candidate source packs* pushed from FlowCommander as a first-class intake path, alongside curated source packs during bootstrap
- use the OpenAI API for schema-bound extraction and wiki compilation
- produce a human-readable compiled wiki
- apply guardrails so low-signal operational material (e.g. ambiguous correspondence, unlabeled field photos) does not become published knowledge, and surface rejections back to the FlowCommander promoter
- publish approved wiki artifacts into FlowCommander by PR
- preserve provenance and rerun safety, including back-references to originating FlowCommander artifact IDs where applicable
- leave room for future Ask AI integration

### Non-goals for v1
- no user-facing web app first
- no hosted Supabase digestion
- no raw chunk embeddings as source of truth
- no fully automatic contradiction resolution
- no silent direct writes into FlowCommander main

## Recommended technical direction

### Proposed v1 stack
- Python
- Prefect for orchestration
- OCRmyPDF for scan normalization
- Docling as primary parser
- MinerU or Marker as fallback parser
- OpenAI API for structured extraction and wiki compilation
- OpenAI Batch API for corpus-scale processing
- Markdown wiki compiler
- Git and PR publish flow into FlowCommander

## OpenAI inference layer

OpenAI inference is a first-class subsystem.

It should be used for:
- structured extraction of procedures, warnings, specs, troubleshooting entries, applicability rules, and revision notes
- normalization of parsed sections into canonical forms
- wiki compilation into readable Markdown pages
- contradiction and supersession candidate analysis inside scoped buckets

### Two inference modes
1. Direct request mode
   - prompt development
   - debugging
   - single-document testing

2. Batch mode
   - backlog runs
   - section-by-section extraction
   - corpus-scale wiki compilation
   - future embeddings

The system should support request logging, retry and repair, token and cost accounting, batch job building, batch result ingestion, and provenance attachment.

## High-level pipeline

### Stage 0: intake and manifest
Every source document gets a manifest entry with fields such as:
- source path
- checksum
- manufacturer
- family
- model applicability
- document type (see source material scope above)
- document class: `authoritative-technical`, `operational`, or `contextual`
- revision
- publication date
- language
- priority
- processing status

### Stage 1: pre-bucketing
Assign manuals to buckets before parsing or LLM extraction.

Core bucket dimensions:
- manufacturer
- product family
- model or applicability
- document type
- revision authority
- publication date or revision order

### Stage 2: OCR and normalization
Normalize scanned or inconsistent PDFs before parsing.

### Stage 3: parsing
Use a layout-aware parser first and save:
- markdown
- structured JSON
- heading tree
- table outputs
- page map
- parse metadata
- quality notes

### Stage 4: canonical sectioning
Split parsed content into meaningful sections such as:
- safety
- installation
- configuration
- startup
- shutdown
- maintenance (preventive, corrective, seasonal)
- troubleshooting
- specifications
- parts
- revision notes
- workflow / SOP / checklist
- inspection / commissioning
- wiring / drawings / diagrams
- addenda / bulletins

### Stage 5: OpenAI structured extraction
Convert parsed sections into canonical records.

### Stage 6: OpenAI wiki compilation
Generate human-readable Markdown artifacts.

### Stage 7: review and publish
Stage outputs and open PRs into FlowCommander.

## Wiki output strategy

Generated wiki artifacts should eventually publish into FlowCommander under a dedicated subtree such as:

```text
repo-wiki/
  knowledge/
    manufacturers/
    families/
    procedures/
    specs/
    troubleshooting/
    source-index/
    _manifests/
    _sources/
    _publish-log/
```

### Page types
1. Source pages
   - one page per source manual
   - include metadata, revision, parser used, extraction quality notes, section index, and unresolved issues

2. Compiled topic pages
   - startup procedures
   - alarm references
   - specs
   - troubleshooting
   - include normalized content, applicability, citations, and contradiction notes

3. Family overview pages
   - controller family overviews
   - pump family overviews
   - model group overviews

## Data model concepts

Even if the first implementation is filesystem-first, the architecture should center on explicit entities:
- `document`
- `document_version`
- `bucket_assignment`
- `parse_run`
- `section`
- `extracted_record`
- `contradiction_candidate`
- `compiled_page`
- `publish_run`

Example record types:
- `procedure`
- `procedure_step`
- `warning`
- `spec_value`
- `alarm_definition`
- `troubleshooting_entry`
- `part_reference`
- `applicability`
- `revision_note`
- `supersession_candidate`
- `contradiction_candidate`

Every extracted record should preserve provenance:
- source document id
- source page range
- source heading
- revision or date
- parser version
- extraction version
- confidence
- bucket context

## Key docs

- `AGENTS.md` — repo-specific agent operating conventions
- `docs/agent-workflow.md` — two-repo working model and local workflow
- `docs/publish-contract.md` — downstream FlowCommander publish boundary
- `docs/repo-structure.md` — current scaffold and planned artifact layout

## Contradiction and supersession

Version 1 should not try to resolve contradictions across the whole corpus.
It should only compare records inside scoped buckets.

Suggested precedence:
1. service bulletin or addendum
2. revised manual (installation, operation, or service)
3. original manual
4. OEM datasheet or specification sheet
5. internal SOP or best practice
6. quick start or supplemental guide
7. training material or technician reference
8. non-authoritative material

Compare only when these overlap:
- manufacturer
- family
- applicability
- claim type
- topic subject

Outputs should include:
- contradiction candidate records
- supersession candidate records
- wiki notes showing competing claims and sources

## For Opus

Use this repo to create the roadmap, epics, and incremental issue stack. Do not try to build everything in one issue. Break the work into clean, testable phases that Codex can ship with focused PRs.

## For Codex later

Work the next canonical roadmap issue in `TNwkrk/knowledge-forge`. Follow the architecture docs and publish contract. Make the smallest complete implementation that satisfies the issue cleanly, with tests and docs where needed. Preserve provenance, rerun safety, and the separation between digestion and FlowCommander publish integration.
